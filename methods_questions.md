1. _What’s the right role for QA in the software development process?_
1. _As a QA person, you have 2 weeks to prepare before your team starts writing software. What do
you do?_
1. _When is it appropriate to use automated testing? When is it appropriate to use manual testing?_
1. _Your dev team has just modified an existing product by adding new features and refactoring the
code for old features. The devs claim to have written unit tests; you’re in charge of integration
testing. Dedicated teams are handling performance and security testing, so you don’t have to. As
is always the case in the real world, you don’t have time to test everything. What factors do you
think about as you decide where to focus your testing efforts? How do you decide what not to
test?_
