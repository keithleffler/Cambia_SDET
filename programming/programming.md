## Problem Statement

_The solution must be runnable with a Docker command (i.e., include a Dockerfile)._

Imagine a CSV file called input.csv, which contains a single line of comma-separated strings. This
single line is terminated with a new line character. Using Python, write a program that reads
input.csv, sorts its strings into descending alphabetical order, and writes the sorted strings in
comma-separated format to a new file called output.csv.
Here are sample contents of these two files (but your program should handle other content as well):

• input file: Copenhagen,Stockholm,Oslo

• output file: Stockholm,Oslo,Copenhagen
