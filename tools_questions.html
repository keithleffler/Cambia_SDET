<p><strong>Helpful</strong> * They allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, without over-writing other's work. * They provide a (hopefully) safe backup for files, including history of every change for every file. * Some systems allow individual developers to keep multiple versions of the same code base.</p>
<p><strong>Annoying</strong> * Multiple versions of binary files are not always handled well. This sometimes creates a need for a separate location(s) to store binary files. * Developers may be able to alter or revert a lot of other people's work, sometimes purposely, sometimes by accident. * It is possible to keep changes on branches for too long, and the changes become difficult or impossible to re-integrate.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-pros-and-cons-of-using-docker-to-develop-test-and-deploy-software"><em>What are some pros and cons of using Docker to develop, test, and deploy software?</em></h2>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> * Applications are portable to any environment supporting Docker. * There is an incentive to break monolithic applications into a collection of Docker applications, each supporting a single feature. * It facilitates service-oriented architectures.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> * Developers may require a change in mindset, and additional training. (This could be seen as a Pro) * Developing for Docker adds another layer of completely over an application installed into the host operating system.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-choose-which-language-to-use-for-a-given-task"><em>How do you choose which language to use for a given task?</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Choose a language, or at least a language type, that supports the problem space. Java EE and C# would be good choices for writing enterprise applications. Low level C would involve a lot of extra work.<br /></li>
<li>Once a language class is determined, choose a language that fits the customer. Microsoft technologies may not be the best choice for an organization that relies solely on Unix and Java.</li>
<li>Choose a language that the developers know well, or can learn with enough time to complete the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>### <em>How did you choose the language for the programming exercise above?</em> The instructions specified that the exercise must be completed using Python.</p>
