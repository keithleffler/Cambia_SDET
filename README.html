<p><em>The solution must be runnable with a Docker command (i.e., include a Dockerfile).</em></p>
<p>Imagine a CSV file called input.csv, which contains a single line of comma-separated strings. This single line is terminated with a new line character. Using Python, write a program that reads input.csv, sorts its strings into descending alphabetical order, and writes the sorted strings in comma-separated format to a new file called output.csv. Here are sample contents of these two files (but your program should handle other content as well):</p>
<p>• input file: Copenhagen,Stockholm,Oslo</p>
<p>• output file: Stockholm,Oslo,Copenhagen</p>
<p>Code for the solution can be found <a href="./programming/rev_sort">HERE</a> The solution can be run with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cd ./programming/rev_sort docker build -t rev_sort . docker run rev_sort:latest</p>
